# Skin-Cancer-Detection
#Tensorflow Model
This is a Tensorflow model of Skin Cancer Detection using python and importing Biopython modules. 
Data science and Deep learning modules will enhance the accuracy of the model. 
#The model will train dermatographic datasets
#The input lesion image will be preprocessed and trained to give the output as Benign or Malignant as per the lesion morphology.
